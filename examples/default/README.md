# End to end example with default values

An end-to-end example that uses the module's default variable values.
This example uses the IBM Cloud terraform provider to:
 - Create a new resource group if one is not passed in.
 - Create a new Key Protect instance in the resource group.
 - Create a Key Ring within the Key Protect Instance.

<!-- Add your example and link to it from the module's main readme file. -->
